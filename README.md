# HTML5-classes
This repository is used to curate various HTML5 codes.
We have different code structures that would be added to this repo

{Third brain teaser} I am the owner of a school named Christland International College, where we have twenty students, five males and fifteen females. The males and females are arranged in context of both ordered and unordered forms, where the males and females study three different subjects: Maths, Physics and Chemistry. The average score for the male students is 70% in maths, 75% in chemistry and 86% in physics while for the female students, the average score in maths is 70%, 72% in physics and 90% in chemistry. Deduce it using the normal HTML principle.

{fifth brain teaser} A professional content manager who uses different mailing platforms to send out mails every single day, sends mails in HTML5 formats embedding CSS inside. The content of the mail being sent, is this: Responsive HTML email template is the content of the mail being sent. The content manager sends this mail with three different kinds of buttons. The first button he sends is a blue button the second is a grey button and the third is a brown button. Deduce the brain teaser context.

{Fourth brain teaser} A malicious user who works in the darkweb uses a certain method to trick unsuspecting victims. He started by using three different tags by default. The first tag makes reference to the uniformity of links where we have multiple links ranging from 0-9 sent to one e-mail address. The other tags are focused on phone number and a text file. The content of the text file is this: " for God so oved the world that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever beleives in him shall not perish but have evrlasting life".
