I am the owner of a school named Christland International College, where we have twenty students, five males and fifteen females. The males and females are arranged in context of both ordered and unordered forms, where the males and females study three different subjects: Maths, Physics and Chemistry. The average score for the male students is 70% in maths, 75% in chemistry and 86% in physics while for the female students, the average score in maths is 70%, 72% in physics and 90% in chemistry. Deduce it using the normal HTML principle.
